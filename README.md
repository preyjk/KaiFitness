## Overview
In today's society, life is becoming more and more fast-paced and people are more and more concerned about fitness and healthy eating. A large number of apps exist on the market that focus on fitness or recipes, however, there are few web apps that combine fitness and diet plans. Therefore, finding reliable resources and apps to help individuals with fitness and healthy eating can be a challenge.

In order to address this reality and achieve our goals, our team (Jade Jaguars), after many discussions and meetings, finalized the development of a website that would cater to all of the resources needed for individuals looking to live a healthy lifestyle. The web platform will include a separate front-end and back-end that will focus primarily on providing fitness tutorials and healthy eating recipes. In addition, the platform will offer personalized services such as daily calorie counts and user-tailored fitness and diet plans. The fitness tutorials will cover a variety of topics including workout plans, exercise tips and fitness challenges. In addition to the fitness tutorials, the site will offer a variety of healthy eating recipes to meet users' fitness goals. Recipes will include several options including low-calorie, high-protein and vegetarian.

In terms of technology selection, our team has adopted MERN as the primary technology stack to implement the desired functionality. the MERN stack has many advantages such as flexibility, ease of learning, rapid development and robust performance, which can help us build a The MERN technology stack consists of four main technologies: React, Node.js, MongoDB and Express.
